# heinsight_fsm_search

A basic web search facility to look up the proportion of pupils eligible for Free School Meals in English schools. 

The data used is taken from the 2022-23 series of 'Schools, pupils and their characteristics' available at https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/school-pupils-and-their-characteristics. This repository includes both an extract of relevant columns from the dataset in the form of a csv and the html/javascript, php and css files which provide the search facility.
